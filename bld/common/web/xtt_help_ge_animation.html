<H1>Demo Animation</H1>
<BR>
<H2>Cyclic sequence</H2>
The subgraph to the left, a square with a ball, has the dynamic Animation, and is connected <BR>
a digital attribute. You can toggle the value of the attribute with the Toggle button.<BR>
<BR>
The dynamic Animation can be applied to a subgraph containing several pages, that, when <BR>
displayed in a sequence, gives the illusion of movement. When the value of the attribute<BR>
is set, the animation is started, and continues until the value is reset.<BR>
<BR>
In Sequence Cyclic the animation is repeated from the second to the last page as long as <BR>
the attributes value is true. When the attribute value is false, the first page is displayed.<BR>
<BR>
<H2>Dig sequence</H2>
The Dig sequence shifts between two resting position. The first position (first page) is <BR>
displayed when the attribute value is false, and the second position (last page) when<BR>
the value is true. When the value shifts, the pages of the animation are run through forward<BR>
(on positive edge) or backwards (on negative edge).<BR>
<BR>
<H2>ForwBack sequence</H2>
ForwBack sequece is similar to the Cyclic sequence, but now the animation runs first forward <BR>
and then backwards then the attribute value is true.<BR>
