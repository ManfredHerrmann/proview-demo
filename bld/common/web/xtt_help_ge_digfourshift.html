The traffic light to the left has the dynamic DigFourShift. The traffic light is a<BR>
subgraph with four pages, because besides changing the colors when the light switches,<BR>
also the shape is changed. The traffic light is connected to tree digital attributes<BR>
that shifts to different pages. You can toggle the value of the attributes with the <BR>
Toggle buttons.<BR>

non of the signals are set, the first page is displayed, when the first signal is set,<BR>
the second page is displayed, when the second signal is set the third page is displayed etc. <BR>
