<H1>Demo DigSound</H1><BR>
<BR>
The DigSound dynamic plays a sound specified by a Sound object. In this case, it <BR>
is actually the Toggle button that contains the DigSound dynamic. The Sound dynamic <BR>
is connected to a digital attribute. You can toggle  the value of the attribute with <BR>
the Toggle pushbutton.<BR>
<BR>
In the first example, the sound is played when the attribute value is set to true.<BR>
<BR>
In the second example, where the Level property is set, the sound is played as long<BR>
as the value is true, with the specified interval.<BR>
<BR>
Note that DigSound requires that alsa is installed.<BR>
