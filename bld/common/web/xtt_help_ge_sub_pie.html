<H1>Demo Subgraph Pie</H1>
<BR>
The two Pie objects are configured with 5 sectors, and  and each sector is <BR>
connected to an analog determining the size of the sector.<BR>
<BR>
For the left pie, FixRange is set to 0. This means that the total range is<BR>
calculated to the current sum of all the sectors. Thus the sectors will always<BR>
fill the diagram.<BR>
<BR>
The right pie has FixRange set to 1, and the total range is 50. Only when<BR>
all sectors has reached their max value 10, the whole diagram is filled.<BR>
<BR>
Move the sliders to modify the size of the sectors.<BR>
