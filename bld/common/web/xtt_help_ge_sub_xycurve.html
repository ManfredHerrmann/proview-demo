<H1>Demo Subgraph XYCurve</H1>
<BR>
The XYCurve object is configured for four curves, and each curve is connected to two arrays <BR>
containing the x and y coordinates for the curves. Actually all four curves has the same<BR>
x-coordinates and shares the same x-coordinate array. The values here are fix and counting<BR>
from 0 to 99. <BR>
<BR>
The values for the y-coordinate arrays are calculated from the values of four<BR>
Av objects. New values will be calculated when one of the sliders is moved. When the<BR>
slider is released, a Dv is set to indicate that the curves should be updated. <BR>
<BR>
Move the sliders to modify the shapes of the curves.<BR>
