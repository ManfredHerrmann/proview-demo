<H1>Demo Tone</H1>
<BR>
The picture to the left, a cube with a ball,  has 27 instances of the dynamic DigTone <BR>
(the combination of DigColor and Tone), and also one instance of DigColor. Each instance <BR>
is connected to a digital attribute, and the values of the attributes are toggled with the <BR>
pushbuttons. When an attributes is high, the corresponding pushbutton is yellow, otherwise <BR>
it is grey.<BR>
<BR>
To understand the difference between DigColor and DigTone, press the 'Red Fillcolor' button.<BR>
This has the dynamic DigColor, which set the same fill color on every part of the picture.<BR>
All the fine shadows disappears and the picture becomes totaly flat. <BR>
<BR>
Reset the 'Red Fillcolor' attribute by pressing the button again, and press one of the other <BR>
buttons to activate the DigTone dynamic. See how a color is applied to the picure, but now, <BR>
the shadows are still there.<BR>
<BR>
The DigTone dynamic will color each part of the picture with a color, but keep the original<BR>
lightness of the part, while the DigColor will color each part with the same color and lightness,<BR>
indepented of its original lightness.<BR>
