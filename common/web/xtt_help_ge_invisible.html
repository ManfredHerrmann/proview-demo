<H1>Demo Invisible</H1><BR>
<BR>
The pushbutton to the left has two instances of the dynamic Invisible, Each instance is <BR>
connected to a digital attribute. You can toggle the values of the attributes with the Toggle <BR>
pushbuttons.<BR>
<BR>
The first instance has the Dimmed proprety set. When the value of the attribute is set, the<BR>
pushbutton is dimmed and made insensitive.<BR>
<BR>
The second instance (without Dimmed), will make the pushbutton invisible when the attribute<BR>
value is set.<BR>
<BR>
As usual, higher instance number has higher priority.<BR>
