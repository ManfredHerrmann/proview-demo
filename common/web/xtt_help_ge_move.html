<H1>Demo Move</H1><BR>
<BR>
The dice to the left has the dynamic Move, and is connected to four analog<BR>
attributes, which scales and moves the dice in x and y direction. You can change <BR>
the values of the attributes from the input fields or with the sliders.<BR>
<BR>
Start to set a value to the x and y scale attributes to make the dice visible.<BR>
Now you can see how the dice is moved by changing the position attributes, and<BR>
scaled by changing the scale attributes.<BR>
